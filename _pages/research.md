# Research Projects


### 1. Model Interpretability and Robustness

In addition to prediction accuracy, interpretability and robustness should also be considered as two intrinsic properties. The research in this lab focuses on 

- providing rich forms of interpretations (e.g., [Chen et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02015); [Chen et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04488))
- improving model interpretability and robustness (e.g., [Chen and Ji, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00667))

### 2. Text Generation

Automatically generating texts is a fundamental challenge in natural language processing and connected to many real-world applications, such as conversation modeling and story generation.
To address this challenge, we are working on 

- building neural network models to incorporate contextual information (e.g., [Clark et al., 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1204/));
- developing algorithms for effectively training neural network models (e.g., [Du and Ji, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10835)); and
- reconsider the whole evaluation pipeline (e.g., [Schoch et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.evalnlgeval-1.2/))
