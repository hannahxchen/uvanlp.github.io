# Research Projects


### 1. Model Interpretability and Robustness

In addition to prediction accuracy, interpretability and robustness should also be considered as two intrinsic properties. The research in this lab focuses on 

- providing rich forms of interpretations ([Chen et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02015); [Chen et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04488))
- improving model interpretability and robustness ([Chen and Ji, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00667))

### 2. Text Generation

Generating texts with rich context is a long-term challenge in natural language generation. To address this challenge, we are working on 

- building neural network models to incorporate contextual information ([Clark et al., 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1204/)); and 
- developing algorithms for effectively training neural network models ([Du and Ji, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10835))

### 3. Text Dataset Analysis
