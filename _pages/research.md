# Research Projects


### 1. Model Interpretability and Robustness

In addition to prediction accuracy, interpretability and robustness should also be considered as two intrinsic properties. The research in this lab focuses on 

- providing rich forms of interpretations (e.g., [Chen et al., 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.494/); [Chen et al., 2021](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.naacl-main.306/));
- improving model interpretability and robustness (e.g., [Chen and Ji, 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.347/)).

### 2. Text Generation

Automatically generating texts is a fundamental challenge in natural language processing and connected to many real-world applications, such as conversation modeling and story generation.
To address this challenge, we are working on 

- building neural network models to incorporate contextual information (e.g., [Clark et al., 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1204/));
- developing algorithms for effectively training neural network models (e.g., [Du and Ji, 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1619/), [Du and Ji, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01958)); and
- reconsider the whole evaluation pipeline (e.g., [Schoch et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.evalnlgeval-1.2/)).

### 3. Text Dataset Analysis

We are interested in various issues of data-related problems in data-driven NLP research

- learning with noisy labels (e.g., [Chen et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.426/));
- data selection to improve learning (e.g., [Schoch et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07871))
